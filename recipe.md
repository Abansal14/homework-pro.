Add your butter, eggs, coffee, and vanilla to a large bowl then whisk together. 
Add the sugars to the mixture. 
Whisk the mixture together until it’s nice and smooth.
Sift in the flour, salt, and cocoa powder. 
Stir the mixture together until just incorporated.
Fold in the chocolate chips or chunks. While you have the spatula out it’s a good time to scrape the bottom of the bowl and really make sure there are no pockets of unmixed ingredients hanging out.
Transfer the batter to a lined baking dish and smooth it to the corners then bake.
